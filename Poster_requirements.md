# Poster guidelines

### General tips:   

* https://guides.nyu.edu/posters *(clicking poster images links to more detailed descriptions)*

* **Space is valuable**: include things necessary to understand the project, but keep the minutiae of your work to oral explanations

* **Readability is paramount**: prepare the poster for <number> DPI and <size> format, ensure that all elements can be read from a slight distance

* **Keep it concise**: if one of the sections outlined below does not bring value to your poster, skip it. Overload of information can turn the best work into a muddy and confusing sorcery

* **Promote your work**: upload your poster to http://datascienceprojects.ml/ and provide a handy QR code to access it, directly from the physical version of your poster

* **Example posters**: [.psd file](poster_example_psd.7zip), [.tex file](poster_example_tex.zip); do note that .tex poster contains more text than advised, as it was prepared for being shown even when the author was not around to properly explain and present
